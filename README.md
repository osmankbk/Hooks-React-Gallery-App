# Hooks-React-Gallery-App
Re-created my react gallery app using the React Hooks library.

Be sure to cd into the "reaction" folder first, before installing the project dependencies.
Apply for a Non-Commercial API Key from flickr
Add a "config.js" file in your 'src' folder, that holds the Apikey you get from flickr, and export it.
